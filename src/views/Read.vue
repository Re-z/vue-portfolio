          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>In 2018, a genetic study found that just prior to 1859 a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Pastore d'Oropa, and the it:Cane da pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai.[43]</p>
          <p>In the 1800s northwest Europe (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands) the most common dog used to herd sheep and protect the homes was the so-called "continental shepherd dog". These dogs all looked very similar at that time, and it was around 1890 that the three breeds (Belgian Shepherd, German Shepherd and Dutch Shepherd) went their separate ways. Of those breeds, the Dutch shepherd looks closest to the continental shepherd of that time.[44]</p>

          <h2>Etymology</h2>
          <p>
              German Shepherd Dogs. Female (left), male (right).
              The breed was named Deutscher Schäferhund by von Stephanitz, literally translating to "German Shepherd Dog". The breed was so named due to its original purpose of assisting shepherds in herding and protecting sheep. At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Schäferhunde, or Old German Shepherd Dogs.</p>
          <p>The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the official breed registry; however, at the conclusion of World War I, it was believed that the inclusion of the word "German" would harm the breed's popularity,[51] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[52] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to "Alsatian Wolf Dog",[51] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[27] This name was also adopted by many other international kennel clubs.</p>
          <p>Eventually, the appendage "wolf dog" was dropped,[51] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[27] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[51] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[53] The word "Alsatian" still appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name and was only removed in 2010.[54]</p>
